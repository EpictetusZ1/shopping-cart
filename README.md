## Functionality

- Fetch data from nasa's Images API (The images API contains 4 endpoints```GET https://images-api.nasa.gov``` ) to populate store products dynamically
- Get image URLs from manifest (manifest follows 'Collection+JSON' formatting)
- Prices are also generated at random *once* in the component lifecycle then used throughout the users' entire session, never changing.
- App features 3 Routes:
    1. Home: ```"/"``` (This includes Hero image and CTA)
    3. Shop: ```"/shop"``` (Product Catalogue)
    4. Cart: ```"/shop/cart"```

## Things I Learned

- Handling API calls in Functional Components with the useEffect hook (equivalent to ```componentDidMount``` in class components)
    - ```useEffect( () => {... DoSomething} ,[])```
- The importance of preforming API calls **only once**, then setting the component state with the returned value
- The *intricacies* of updating Objects inside of Arrays (or any nested / deeply nested state) with the ```useState( (prevState) => ...prevState)```  syntax
    - Note: This has made me resent deeply nested state enough to learn Redux
